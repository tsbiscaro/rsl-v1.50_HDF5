RSL requires the following packages do be installed first:

flex
libfl-dev
libbz2-dev
zlib1g-dev
libhdf5-serial-dev (or libghdf5-dev, depending on the system)
autoconf
automake
make
libtool

How to compile:

Run the script pre_compile.sh

chmod +x pre_compile.sh
./pre_compile.sh

Check where the files libhdf5.a and libhdf5_hl.a are located (e.g.: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial/)

To find them run (as root):
updatedb
locate libhdf5.a
locate libhdf5_hl.a


Check where the hdf5.h file is located (e.g.: /usr/include/hdf5/serial/)

To find it run (as root):
updatedb
locate hdf5.h

Export the paths to the CFLAGS environment variable:

export CFLAGS='-I/usr/include/hdf5/serial/ -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial/'

run configure - if you want to install as single user at the same directory use:

./configure --prefix=`pwd`

run make:

make

install:

make install

export the RSL path to your bashrc file: 

echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
